Magnacanos!!!

This is an explosively wonderful game about space volcanoes!!!

More accurately, Magnacanos (working title) is a game concept we are working to create in javascript. Here are some details that will guide our development.

Concept

In space, there are antimatter "volcanoes." These hold back compressed matter much in the same way regular volcanoes hold back magma.

The player's job is to reach a destination by causing these space volcanoes to erupt. When the volcanoes erupt, matter explodes into the universe creating new centers of gravity with platforms surrounding them. The player will navigate from center of gravity to center of gravity to reach a goal (probably a door... or maybe a pony). Along the way, the player will have to erupt volcanoes to gain access to new platforms that bring them closer to their goal.
